## everything about Ashara Dayne

#### A Game of Thrones

###### Catelyn

> That cut deep. Ned would not speak of the mother, not so much as a word, but a castle has no secrets, and Catelyn heard her maids repeating tales they heard from the lips of her husband’s soldiers. They whispered of Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning, deadliest of the seven knights of Aerys’s Kingsguard, and of how their young lord had slain him in single combat. And they told how afterward Ned had carried Ser Arthur’s sword back to the beautiful young sister who awaited him in a castle called Starfall on the shores of the Summer Sea. The Lady Ashara Dayne, tall and fair, with haunting violet eyes. It had taken her a fortnight to marshal her courage, but finally, in bed one night, Catelyn had asked her husband the truth of it, asked him to his face.  <br/>
That was the only time in all their years that Ned had ever frightened her. “Never ask me about Jon,” he said, cold as ice. “He is my blood, and that is all you need to know. And now I will learn where you heard that name, my lady.” She had pledged to obey; she told him; and from that day on, the whispering had stopped, and Ashara Dayne’s name was never heard in Winterfell again.

　　这件事伤她很深，奈德非但不肯说出孩子的母亲，连关系情形半个字也不跟她提。然而城堡里没有不透风的墙，凯特琳很快就从她的侍女群中听说了几种揣测，这些都是从跟随她丈夫打仗的士兵嘴里传出来的。她们交头接耳说着外号“拂晓神剑”的亚瑟·戴恩爵士，说他是伊里斯麾下御林七铁卫中武艺最高强的骑士，但他们的年轻主子却在一对一的决斗中击毙了他。她们还绘声绘影地叙述事后奈德是如何地带着亚瑟爵士的佩剑，前往盛夏海岸的星坠城寻找亚瑟的妹妹。她们说亚夏拉·戴恩小姐皮肤白皙，身材高挑，一双紫罗兰色的眸子深邃而幽冷。她想了两个星期才终于鼓起勇气，某天夜里在床上向丈夫当面问起。  
　　然而，那却是两人结婚多年以来，奈德惟一吓着她的一次。“永远不要跟我问起琼恩的事，”他的口气寒冷如冰，“他是我的亲生骨肉，你只需知道这点就够了。现在，夫人，我要知道你是打哪儿听来这名字的。”她向他保证以后不会再提起这件事，于是便把消息来源告诉了他。翌日起，城中一切谣言戛然而止，临冬城中从此再听不到亚夏拉·戴恩这个名字。

###### Eddard

> Be kind to me, Ned. I swear to you, you shall never regret it.”  <br/>
“Did you make the same offer to Jon Arryn?”  <br/>
She slapped him.  <br/>
“I shall wear that as a badge of honor,” Ned said dryly.
“Honor,” she spat. “How dare you play the noble lord with me! What do you take me for? You’ve a bastard of your own, I’ve seen him. Who was the mother, I wonder? Some Dornish peasant you raped while her holdfast burned? A whore? Or was it the grieving sister, the Lady Ashara? She threw herself into the sea, I’m told. Why was that? For the brother you slew, or the child you stole? Tell me, my honorable Lord Eddard, how are you any different from Robert, or me, or Jaime?”

　　”奈德，对我好一点，我发誓绝不让你后悔。”  
　　“你当初也是这么向琼恩·艾林提议吗？”  
　　她甩了他一个耳光。  
　　“我会把这当成荣誉的奖章。”奈德冷冷地说。  
　　“去你的荣誉，”她啐道，“少给我道貌岸然！你把我当什么了？你自己也有个私生子，我亲眼见过。我很好奇他的母亲是谁？是不是哪个家园被你放火烧掉，随后被你强奸的多恩农家女？还是个婊子？或者是那个哀伤的妹妹，亚夏拉小姐？我听说，当你将拂晓神剑那把‘黎明’送还给她后，她便从城墙投海自尽，这到底是什么缘故啊？是因为被你所杀的哥哥，还是被你偷走的孩子？告诉我啊，最讲究荣誉的艾德大人，你和劳勃，或是我，或是詹姆，究竟有什么差别？”

#### A Clash of Kings

###### Catelyn

> Her own children had more Tully about them than Stark. Arya was the only one to show much of Ned in her features. And Jon Snow, but he was never mine. She found herself thinking of Jon’s mother, that shadowy secret love her husband would never speak of. Does she grieve for Ned as I do? Or did she hate him for leaving her bed for mine? Does she pray for her son as I have prayed for mine?  <br/>
They were uncomfortable thoughts, and futile. If Jon had been born of Ashara Dayne of Starfall, as some whispered, the lady was long dead; if not, Catelyn had no clue who or where his mother might be. And it made no matter. Ned was gone now, and his loves and his secrets had all died with him.

就她自己的孩子而论，徒利方面的特征就比史塔克方面的来得明显。长得和奈德相仿的只有艾莉亚，以及琼恩·雪诺，但他不是我的孩子。她不禁又想起琼恩的母亲，想起奈德谜一般的影子爱侣，想起丈夫一直不肯提起的“她”。她也为奈德哀悼么?她恨他选择了我而抛弃了她吗?她也同我一样在为孩子祈祷吗?
这些念头让她不安，她知道它们毫无意义。如果谣言属实，琼恩真是星坠城的亚夏拉·戴恩所生，那他母亲已经丧命很久；如果不是，凯特琳对他母亲的所在和身世就没了一点线索。不过这些都无关紧要。奈德去了，他的爱、他的秘密都和他一同消逝。

#### A Storm of Swords

###### Arya

> “My father was called Ned too,” she said.  <br/>
“I know. I saw him at the Hand’s tourney. I wanted to go up and speak with him, but I couldn’t think what to say.” Ned shivered beneath his cloak, a sodden length of pale purple. “Were you at the tourney? I saw your sister there. Ser Loras Tyrell gave her a rose.”  <br/>
“She told me.” It all seemed so long ago. “Her friend Jeyne Poole fell in love with your Lord Beric.”  <br/>
“He’s promised to my aunt.” Ned looked uncomfortable. “That was before, though. Before he . . .”  <br/>
. . . died? she thought, as Ned’s voice trailed off into an awkward silence. Their horses’ hooves made sucking sounds as they pulled free of the mud.  <br/>
“My lady?” Ned said at last. “You have a baseborn brother . . . Jon Snow?”  <br/>
“He’s with the Night’s Watch on the Wall.” Maybe I should go to the Wall instead of Riverrun.Jon wouldn’t care who I killed or whether I brushed my hair . . . “Jon looks like me, even thoughhe’s bastard-born. He used to muss my hair and call me ‘little sister.’” Arya missed Jon most of all.Just saying his name made her sad. “How do you know about Jon?”  <br/>
“He is my milk brother.”  <br/>
“Brother?” Arya did not understand. “But you’re from Dorne. How could you and Jon beblood?”  <br/>
“Milk brothers. Not blood. My lady mother had no milk when I was little, so Wylla had to nurseme.”  <br/>
Arya was lost. “Who’s Wylla?”  <br/>
“Jon Snow’s mother. He never told you? She’s served us for years and years. Since before I wasborn.”  <br/>
“Jon never knew his mother. Not even her name.” Arya gave Ned a wary look. “You know her?Truly?” Is he making mock of me? “If you lie I’ll punch your face.”  <br/>
“Wylla was my wetnurse,” he repeated solemnly. “I swear it on the honor of my House.”  <br/>
“You have a House?” That was stupid; he was a squire, of course he had a House. “Who are you?”  <br/>
“My lady?” Ned looked embarrassed. “I’m Edric Dayne, the . . . the Lord of Starfall.”  <br/>
Behind them, Gendry groaned. “Lords and ladies,” he proclaimed in a disgusted tone. Arya plucked a withered crabapple off a passing branch and whipped it at him, bouncing it off his thickbull head. “Ow,” he said. “That hurt.” He felt the skin above his eye. “What kind of lady throws crabapples at people?”  <br/>
“The bad kind,” said Arya, suddenly contrite. She turned back to Ned. “I’m sorry I didn’t know who you were. My lord.”  <br/>
“The fault is mine, my lady.” He was very polite.

“我父亲也叫艾德，”她说。  <br/>
“我知道。我在首相的比武大会上见过他，本想上前跟他说话呢，却想不出说什么。”艾德在斗篷下颤抖，淡紫色长斗篷浸满了水。“您也在比武大会上吗?我看到您
姐姐在那儿，洛拉斯·提利尔爵士送她一朵玫瑰。”  <br/>
“她告诉我了。”一千年前的往事。“她的朋友珍妮·普尔爱上了你们的贝里伯爵。”  <br/>
“他跟我姑母订婚了。”艾德有些不安。“但那是从前。在他……”  <br/>
……死之前?她心想，艾德的声音逐渐减弱，变成窘迫的沉默。马蹄在泥泞中踩踏，发出粘乎乎的声音。  <br/>
“小姐?”艾德最后道，“您有个庶出的哥哥……琼恩·雪诺?”  <br/>
“他在长城的守夜人军团服役。”也许我该去长城，而不是奔流城。琼恩不会在乎我杀了谁，或者我梳不梳头发……“琼恩的模样跟我很像，尽管他是私生子。他以前常弄乱我的头发，叫我‘我的小妹’。”艾莉亚最想念琼恩，单单说出他的名字就让她伤心。“你怎么知道琼恩?”  <br/>
“他是我的乳奶兄弟。”  <br/>
“兄弟?”艾莉亚不明白，“但你来自多恩，怎会跟琼恩是亲戚?”  <br/>
“是乳奶兄弟，无血缘关系的。我小时候，母亲大人没有奶水，不得不让薇拉喂奶。”  <br/>
艾莉亚完全糊涂了。“谁是薇拉?”  <br/>
“琼恩·雪诺的母亲，他没告诉您吗?她为我们效力有好多好多年，从我出生以前就开始。” “琼恩从不知道他母亲是谁，甚至连她的名字都不知道。”艾莉亚警惕地看了艾德一眼，“你认识她?真的?”他在开我玩笑?“如果你撒谎，我就揍你的脸。”
“薇拉是我的乳母，”他严肃地重复，“我以我家族的荣誉起誓。”
“你的家族?”真笨!他是个侍从，当然有家族。“你到底是谁啊?”
“小姐?”艾德似乎很窘迫。“我是艾德瑞克·戴恩……星坠城领主。”
詹德利在身后发出呻吟。“领主与小姐，”他用厌恶的语气叫道。艾莉亚顺手从树枝上摘下一颗干瘪的酸果朝他丢去，砸在那颗笨钝的牛脑袋上。“噢，”他说，“好疼。”他摸摸眼睛上方，“哪门子小姐会朝百姓扔东西啊?”
“坏的那种，”艾莉亚说，突然感到几分懊悔，连忙转回头面对艾德。“抱歉，我不知您的身份，大人。”
“是我的错，小姐。”他非常礼貌。

> Jon has a mother. Wylla, her name is Wylla. She would need to remember so she could tell him, the next time she saw him. She wondered if he would still call her “little sister.” I’m not so little anymore. He’d have to call me something else. Maybe once she got to Riverrun she could write Jon a letter and tell him what Ned Dayne had said. “There was an Arthur Dayne,” she remembered. “The one they called the Sword of the Morning.”
“My father was Ser Arthur’s elder brother. Lady Ashara was my aunt. I never knew her, though. She threw herself into the sea from atop the Palestone Sword before I was born.”
“Why would she do that?” said Arya, startled.
Ned looked wary. Maybe he was afraid that she was going to throw something at him. “Your lord father never spoke of her?” he said. “The Lady Ashara Dayne, of Starfall?”
“No. Did he know her?”
“Before Robert was king. She met your father and his brothers at Harrenhal, during the year of the false spring.”
“Oh.” Arya did not know what else to say. “Why did she jump in the sea, though?”
“Her heart was broken.”
Sansa would have sighed and shed a tear for true love, but Arya just thought it was stupid. She couldn’t say that to Ned, though, not about his own aunt. “Did someone break it?”
He hesitated. “Perhaps it’s not my place . . .”
“Tell me.”
He looked at her uncomfortably. “My aunt Allyria says Lady Ashara and your father fell in love at Harrenhal—”
“That’s not so. He loved my lady mother.”
“I’m sure he did, my lady, but—”
“She was the only one he loved.”
“He must have found that bastard under a cabbage leaf, then,” Gendry said behind them.

琼恩有个母亲。薇拉，她叫薇拉。她得记住，下次见面就可以告诉他。她不知琼恩是否还会叫自己“我的小妹”。我已经不小了。他得换个称呼。或许等到了奔流城，就给琼恩写封信，把艾德·戴恩说的告诉他。“有个亚瑟·戴恩，”她记起来，“是什么‘拂晓神剑’。”
“我父亲是亚瑟爵士的哥哥，还有个妹妹亚夏拉小姐——但我从来不认识她，她在我出生之前，就从白石剑塔顶跳进了大海。”
“她为何这么做呀?”艾莉亚惊讶万分地问。
艾德看上去很小心，似乎害怕艾莉亚也朝自己扔东西。“您父亲大人没告诉过您吗?”他问，“星坠城的亚夏拉·戴恩小姐?”
“没有。他认识她?”
“劳勃成为国王之前，她在赫伦堡与您父亲和他的兄弟姐妹们相遇，那一年是错误的春天。”
“哦，”艾莉亚不知该说什么，“她为什么要跳进海里呢?”
“因为她的心碎了。”
珊莎会为真爱而叹息流泪，但艾莉亚觉得那很笨。当然，她不能这么对艾德讲，不能这么说他的亲姑母。“是有人让她心碎吗?”
他犹豫不决，“也许我不该……”
“告诉我嘛。”
他惴惴地看着她，“据我姑母阿莉里亚说，亚夏拉和您父亲在赫伦堡相爱——”
“不会的。他爱我母亲大人。”
“我肯定他很爱，可是，小姐——”
“他只爱她一个。”
“那他一定是在白菜叶子底下找到的私生子。”詹德利在后面说。

> It was Harwin who rode up beside her, in the end. “Where do you think you’re going, milady? You shouldn’t run off. There are wolves in these woods, and worse things.”
“I’m not afraid,” she said. “That boy Ned said . . .”
“Aye, he told me. Lady Ashara Dayne. It’s an old tale, that one. I heard it once at Winterfell, when I was no older than you are now.” He took hold of her bridle firmly and turned her horse around. “I doubt there’s any truth to it. But if there is, what of it? When Ned met this Dornish lady, his brother Brandon was still alive, and it was him betrothed to Lady Catelyn, so there’s no stain on your father’s honor. There’s nought like a tourney to make the blood run hot, so maybe some words were whispered in a tent of a night, who can say? Words or kisses, maybe more, but where’s the harm in that? Spring had come, or so they thought, and neither one of them was pledged.”
“She killed herself, though,” said Arya uncertainly. “Ned says she jumped from a tower into the sea.”
“So she did,” Harwin admitted, as he led her back, “but that was for grief, I’d wager. She’d lost a brother, the Sword of the Morning.” He shook his head. “Let it lie, my lady. They’re dead, all of them. Let it lie . . . and please, when we come to Riverrun, say naught of this to your mother.”

最后是哈尔温骑到她边上。“你想上哪儿去，小姐?你不该独自跑开，森林里有
狼群，还有更糟糕的东西。”
“我才不怕，”她说。“那个叫艾德的男孩说……”
“对，他也告诉了我。亚夏拉·戴恩小姐。这是个老故事，我在临冬城就听过一次，那时跟你差不多大呢。”他牢牢抓住她坐骑的缰绳，圈转过来。“我怀疑其中毫无真相可言。即使有，又怎样呢?你父亲艾德大人与这位多恩的小姐相遇时，他哥哥布兰登仍在世，并跟凯特琳女士订了婚，所以他的荣誉并未遭到玷污。比武大会是最令人热血沸腾的场合，也许某天晚上，某个帐篷，某次幽会，谁说得准呢?幽会，亲吻，也许不止于此，那又有什么害处呢?春天来了，至少当时他们那么想，而且彼此都没有婚约。”
“但她自杀了，”艾莉亚不大确定地说，“艾德说她从一座塔上跳进了海里。”
“她是自杀了，”哈尔温边领她回去，边承认，“我敢打赌，那是因为悲伤，别忘记，
她失去了哥哥，传奇的拂晓神剑。”他摇摇头。“随它去吧，小姐，他们都死了，所有人
都死了，随它去吧……还有，到达奔流城后，千万不要把这些事告诉你母亲。”

> The storm lord drank down the knight of skulls and kisses in a wine-cup war. The crannogman saw a maid with laughing purple eyes dance with a white sword, a red snake, and the lord of griffins, and lastly with the quiet wolf . . . but only after the wild wolf spoke to her on behalf of a brother too shy to leave his bench.

风暴领主斗酒击败了头骨与亲吻骑士。泽地人看到一位少女，她有一双会微笑的、紫罗兰色的眼眸，她跟白袍剑客跳舞，跟红色毒蛇跳舞，跟狮鹫大人跳舞，最后跟那沉默的狼……不过是在野狼替弟弟邀请之后，他弟弟太害羞，不曾离开座位。”
……那天晚上，沉默的狼邀他同住，……

#### A Dance with Dragons

###### Barristan

> Rhaegar had chosen Lyanna Stark of Winterfell. Barristan Selmy would have made a different choice.Not the queen, who was not present. Nor Elia of Dorne, though she was good and gentle; had she been chosen, much war and woe might have been avoided. His choice would have been a young maiden not long at court, one of Elia’s companions … though compared to Ashara Dayne, the Dornish princess was a kitchen drab.
Even after all these years, Ser Barristan could still recall Ashara’s smile, the sound of her laughter. He had only to close his eyes to see her, with her long dark hair tumbling about her shoulders and those haunting purple eyes. Daenerys has the same eyes. Sometimes when the queen looked at him, he felt as if he were looking at Ashara’s daughter …
But Ashara’s daughter had been stillborn, and his fair lady had thrown herself from a tower soon after, mad with grief for the child she had lost, and perhaps for the man who had dishonored her at Harrenhal as well. She died never knowing that Ser Barristan had loved her. How could she? He was a knight of the Kingsguard, sworn to celibacy. No good could have come from telling her his feelings. No good came from silence either. If I had unhorsed Rhaegar and crowned Ashara queen of love and beauty, might she have looked to me instead of Stark?
He would never know. But of all his failures, none haunted Barristan Selmy so much as that.

雷加选择了临冬城的莱安娜·史塔克，巴利斯坦·赛尔弥会做出完全不同的选择。不是王后，她没出席；也非多恩的伊莉亚，尽管她善良温柔，若雷加选她，七国将避免多少战争和灾难，他会选择一位进宫不久的少女，她是伊莉亚的女伴……然而，与亚夏拉·戴恩相比，多恩公主也黯然失色。
时隔多年，亚夏拉的音容笑貌仍然历历在目，巴利斯坦爵士只要闭上眼睛就能看见她：长长的黑发披在肩头，紫色的双眸让人流连。丹妮莉丝有同样的眼睛。有时女王看着他，他觉得自己看到了亚夏拉的女儿……
但亚夏拉的女儿早就胎死腹中，没多久他美丽的女士也跳下高塔，那是出于失去孩子的伤心欲绝，还是因为在赫伦堡玷污她名誉的男人？她至死不知巴利斯坦爵士的感情。她怎会知道？他是御林铁卫的骑士，发誓终身不娶，对她倾诉爱意毫无益处。但保持沉默也无益处。若我将雷加挑落马下，为亚夏拉戴上爱与美的后冠，或许她就会注意我，而非史塔克？
他永远没法知道了。在巴利斯坦·赛尔弥的所有失败中，没有哪次让他这样耿耿于怀。

> Under Harren's roof he ate and drank with the wolves, and many of their sworn swords besides, barrowdown men and moose and bears and mermen. The dragon prince sang a song so sad it made the wolf maid sniffle, but when her pup brother teased her for crying she poured wine over his head. A black brother spoke, asking the knights to join the Night's Watch. The storm lord drank down the knight of skulls and kisses in a wine-cup war. The crannogman saw a maid with laughing purple eyes dance with a white sword, a red snake, and the lord of griffins, and lastly with the quiet wolf . . . but only after the wild wolf spoke to her on behalf of a brother too shy to leave his bench.
--Meera, ASOS

```
In case you don't know, the wolf maid is Lyanna Stark, the pup brother Benjen Stark, the Wild Wolf Brandon Stark, the quiet Wolf, Eddard Stark and the maid with laughing purple eyes is Ashara Dayne. This is reaffirmed by Catelyn.
```
